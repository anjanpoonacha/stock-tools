- ALWAYS use the shadcn ui components.
- ALWAYS keep the components theme compliant - use theme variables (bg-muted, text-foreground, border-border, etc.) instead of hardcoded colors
- ALWAYS add loading states when checking authentication - use isLoading from useAuth() to prevent misleading errors during the 5-second auth check
- NEVER run the `pnpm build` or `npm build` command just to verify if the code is fine, `pnpm dev` command will break.
- ALWAYS run the build command before commiting the changes.
