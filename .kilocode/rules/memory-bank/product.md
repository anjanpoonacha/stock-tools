# MIO TV Scripts - Product Description

## What This Project Is

MIO TV Scripts is a comprehensive web-based trading utility application that serves as a bridge between MarketInOut (MIO) and TradingView platforms. It's designed as a "Swiss Army knife" for stock traders who work across multiple trading platforms and need seamless data synchronization, format conversion, and workflow automation.

## Why This Project Exists

### The Trading Platform Problem
Modern stock traders often use multiple platforms simultaneously:
- **MarketInOut (MIO)**: For advanced screening, research, and Indian market analysis
- **TradingView**: For charting, technical analysis, and watchlist management
- **Telegram**: For community alerts and automated notifications

Each platform uses different stock symbol formats and has isolated watchlist systems, creating friction in trading workflows.

### The Manual Work Problem
Without this tool, traders must:
- Manually convert symbol formats between platforms (TCS.NS â†” NSE:TCS)
- Recreate watchlists on each platform individually
- Copy-paste symbols between different interfaces
- Manually organize and group stocks by sector/industry
- Set up alerts and notifications separately on each platform

## Problems This Project Solves

### 1. Symbol Format Conversion
**Problem**: Different platforms use incompatible symbol formats
- MIO uses: `TCS.NS`, `INFY.NS`, `SBIN.BO`
- TradingView uses: `NSE:TCS`, `NSE:INFY`, `BSE:SBIN`

**Solution**: Bidirectional real-time conversion with support for:
- Bulk conversion of symbol lists
- Multiple delimiter options (comma, space, newline)
- Automatic platform detection
- Grouped/sectioned format support

### 2. Watchlist Synchronization
**Problem**: Watchlists are isolated on each platform
**Solution**: Seamless bi-directional sync between MIO and TradingView:
- Fetch watchlists from both platforms
- Convert formats automatically
- Sync selected watchlists with one click
- Preserve watchlist organization and grouping

### 3. Screener Integration
**Problem**: Moving screener results to watchlists requires manual work
**Solution**: Direct integration with MIO screeners:
- Fetch screener results via API
- Automatically convert to TradingView format
- Group by sector/industry
- Sync directly to TradingView watchlists

### 4. Session Management
**Problem**: Managing authentication across multiple platforms
**Solution**: Secure session bridging:
- Store platform sessions securely
- Automatic session validation
- Seamless cross-platform operations

### 5. Workflow Automation
**Problem**: Repetitive manual tasks in trading workflows
**Solution**: Automated workflows with:
- Telegram integration for alerts
- CSV import/export capabilities
- Saved combination presets
- Bulk operations support

## How It Should Work - User Experience

### Core User Journey: Symbol Conversion
1. **Input**: User pastes a list of symbols in any format
2. **Configure**: Select delimiter and conversion direction
3. **Convert**: One-click conversion with instant results

3. **Configure**: Set grouping options (sector/industry/none)
4. **Preview**: See converted symbols before sync
5. **Sync**: One-click synchronization to target platform
6. **Save**: Store successful combinations for future use

### Power User Journey: Screener to Watchlist
1. **Configure Screeners**: Set up multiple MIO screener URLs
2. **Auto-fetch**: Automatically pull latest screener results
3. **Group & Convert**: Organize by sector/industry, convert to TradingView format
4. **Sync**: Direct sync to TradingView watchlist
5. **Automate**: Set up recurring syncs or Telegram alerts
